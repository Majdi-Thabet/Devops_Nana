## Title : Intro to Cloud and IaaS

In this tutorial, we will set up a **Nexus Artifact Repository**, **Jenkins** for build automation, and deploy our application on servers.

**Important Note:** We will not install these tools locally on our laptops.

We don’t have our own physical servers, so we will use **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** instead.

## **What is IaaS?**

Imagine you and your team are developing a web application. This web app needs to run somewhere, and you also need tools like Jenkins to automate builds. Traditionally, your company would buy physical servers, deploy the app on them, and manage the infrastructure yourself. If something breaks, your team would be responsible for fixing it.

However, managing physical infrastructure can be time-consuming and complex. Instead, you can delegate infrastructure management to a cloud provider. This is where **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** comes in.

With IaaS, you don’t own the servers; you simply rent them from a cloud provider. The provider manages the physical infrastructure, and you focus on deploying and running your applications.

## **Why Use IaaS?**

- **No need to buy or maintain physical servers:** The cloud provider handles the hardware.
- **Scalability:** You can easily scale up or down based on your needs.
- **Cost-effective:** You only pay for what you use.
- **Reliability:** Cloud providers offer high availability and redundancy.

## **AWS: A Leading IaaS Provider**

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is one of the most widely used IaaS platforms. AWS manages the infrastructure for you, and you simply rent the services you need. This allows you to focus on developing and deploying your applications without worrying about the underlying hardware.
